# FastAPI books

The side project of a web application to store information about books, their authors and regular users as readers.

Authors can add their books into the app. Delete and update them.

Users can browse books and save them to favorites.

The aim of this project is to have a go at the following technologies:
- FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL (testing some advanced queries on a big database)
- Angular (frontend simple AF)
- Cloud Run (deployment of the application on Google Cloud run as a Serverless solution)
- Cloud SQL (communicate with the prod DB in the cloud)
- Artifacts registry in Google Cloud
- Testing app (backend in pytest | E2E tests with Selenium )
- CI/CD with github actions
...

Later on:
- Kubernetes (Google Kubernetes Engine to try how it works)
